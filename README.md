# Spree PayPal Express

## THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY.

This is a "re-do" of the official [spree_paypal_express][4] extension. The old extension is extremely hard to maintain and complex.

Please attempt to use this extension *only in development* and report issues.

This blog post was a godsend: http://codecube.teclacolorida.com/2013/01/21/integration-of-paypal-express-checkout-using-active-merchant/.
